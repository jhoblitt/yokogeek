Description
===========

This is a WordPress [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) of
the [Yoko theme](http://www.elmastudio.de/wordpress-themes/yoko/).

It consists of minor modifications primarily to better handle wide pre tag
content as is common for code and command line examples.  It also adds a few
new page templates that, unlike the base Yoko templates, do not allow comments.

Installation
============

* Download and install the Yoko theme from the WP [themes site](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/yoko).
* Checkout this git repo under $wpdir/wp-content/themes/

The file tree should look something like this:

    wp/wp-content/themes
                  ├── yoko
                  └── yokogeek

Configuration
=============

Activate the "yokogeek" theme via the WP admin panel under Apperance->Themes then follow the excellent [Yoko Documentation](http://www.elmastudio.de/wp-content/uploads/themes/yoko-theme-documentation-en.pdf).
